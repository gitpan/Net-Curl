This package is working and the interface is mostly stable.

** WWW::Curl compatibility **

For packages requiring WWW::Curl you can use Net::Curl instead of WWW::Curl
if you don't want to install WWW::Curl in your system. Can be useful in
space-constrained systems if you already have something that requires
Net::Curl anyways.

Set environment variable WWW_COMPAT to "ext" before calling Makefile.PL
to install WWW/Curl/* wrapper files directly.

By default build system creates Net::Curl::Compat package which can be used
to enable WWW::Curl compatibility in Net::Cutl, but it must be loaded manually
before something tries to use WWW::Curl.

** TODO **

XS:
- under coro and threads, when forcibly destroyed, there are some ways to
  make it leak or double-free memory, must be investigated further.

Easy:
- test callback arguments just before perform (maybe only for default writers)
- write more documentation

Form:
- implement read callback
- write more documentation

Multi:
- write more documentation

Share:
- write more documentation

tests:
- use some pure-perl http server, should do for most tests
- review and renumerate
- add more crash tests (remove last reference while performing,
  forced destrution, etc)
